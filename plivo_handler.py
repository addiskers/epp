"""
Plivo Voice <-> Gemini Live bridge.

Handles:
- Plivo bidirectional Audio Streaming WebSocket (mulaw 8kHz)
- Audio conversion: mulaw 8kHz <-> PCM 16kHz (Gemini input) / PCM 24kHz (Gemini output)
- Bridges the two in real-time, with 20ms-paced outbound frames + barge-in (clearAudio)
- Pure Python audio conversion (no audioop, works on Python 3.13+)

Plivo media-stream protocol (JSON text frames):
  inbound  start : {"event":"start","start":{"streamId","callId","mediaFormat":{...}},"extra_headers":"k=v,k=v"}
  inbound  media : {"event":"media","media":{"payload":"<base64 mulaw>","track":"inbound"}}
  inbound  stop  : {"event":"stop", ...}
  outbound play  : {"event":"playAudio","streamId":"<id>","media":{"contentType":"audio/x-mulaw","sampleRate":8000,"payload":"<b64>"}}
  outbound clear : {"event":"clearAudio","streamId":"<id>"}   <- barge-in
Modeled on gvox-voice-proxy/app/plivo_protocol.py.
